## Tangencial Velocity Calculator

Small app to calculate tangencial velocity of a wheel given the RPM (revolutions per minute) and the wheel diameter.
Temporary historial of calculations is shown in the bottom of the screen to allow users to compare results.

units:

- RPM: revolutions per minute
- Diameter: wheel diameter in mm (millimeters)
- Velocity: tangencial velocity in Km/h (kilometers per hour)

### How to use

- Enter the RPM and the diameter of the wheel
- Press the "Calcular" button
- The tangencial velocity will be shown in an alert dialog and stored in the historial
